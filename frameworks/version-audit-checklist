# ✅ Data Contract Version Audit Checklist

Use this checklist to verify semantic versioning compliance and stakeholder approval before publishing a new contract version.

---

## 🔢 Versioning Format
- [ ] Version follows `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` format
- [ ] Change type is correctly classified (breaking, additive, fix)

## 🧪 Validation
- [ ] Contract passes schema validation
- [ ] Linting rules are satisfied (`lint-rules.yaml`)
- [ ] HTML preview renders cleanly for stewards

## 📦 Change Log
- [ ] `change-log-template.md` is updated
- [ ] Summary includes change type, impact, and approvals
- [ ] Version date is accurate

## 👥 Approvals
- [ ] Product Owner has signed off
- [ ] Data Steward group has reviewed
- [ ] Data Executive has approved (if breaking or sensitive)

## 🔐 Governance Alignment
- [ ] Changes align with `access-control-template.yaml`
- [ ] Sensitive fields follow updated `handling` strategies
- [ ] Tags and policies match `policy-links.yaml`

## 🧩 Optional Enhancements
- [ ] `x-versioning:` block used for deprecated fields
- [ ] `externalDocs:` updated for steward-facing summaries
- [ ] `terms.policies` updated if regulatory impact changed
